\minisec{Introduction}

The rise of Agentic Generative AI is rapidly altering workforce dynamics, demanding new skill sets and adaptive learning methodologies. Traditional job roles are evolving, requiring a shift in training paradigms to accommodate AI-augmented workflows. This chapter investigates the transformation of workforce education, emphasizing the importance of retraining and upskilling initiatives tailored to AI integration.

\minisec{The Role of Prompt Engineering in Workforce Adaptation}

Prompt engineering has emerged as a fundamental skill in leveraging AI’s capabilities across various industries. It involves crafting precise inputs to optimize AI-generated outputs, influencing productivity and decision-making processes. Key aspects include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Technical Mastery:} Understanding AI model behaviors and prompt structuring.

\section{Proposals for Remediation}

In a software book, it's often nice to list chapter objectives at the start of the chapter. I do it this way:

\minisec{Chapter Objectives}
\begin{arrows}
\item Some objective
\item Some other objective
\item Another objective
\end{arrows}

\minisec{Code Snippets}

Code snippets are of course also essential in a dev book. Here is a code snippet:

\begin{codeInput}{bash}{terminal}{Installing Express via npm.}
npm install express
\end{codeInput}

Here's a longer code snippet, an MIT license:

\begin{codeInput}{markdown}{LICENSE}{An example MIT license code snippet.}

\end{codeInput}

and an even longer code snippet, an SEO React TypeScript component:

\begin{codeInput}{jsx}{Seo.tsx}{A basic SEO React component.}
import * as React from "react"
import { Helmet } from "react-helmet"
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"
import { siteMetadata } from "../../gatsby-config"

export interface ISeoProps {
  title: string
  description?: string
}

function Seo(props: ISeoProps) {
  const { description, title } = props
  const { site } = useStaticQuery(
    graphql`
      query {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
            description
            author
          }
        }
      }
    `
  )

  return (
    <Helmet>
      {/* General tags */}
      <title>{title}</title>
      <meta
        name="description"
        content={description || siteMetadata.description || ""}
      />
      <meta property="og:title" content={title} />
      <meta
        property="og:description"
        content={description || siteMetadata.description || ""}
      />

      {/* Twitter Card tags */}
      <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
      <meta name="twitter:creator" content={site.siteMetadata?.author || ""} />
      <meta name="twitter:title" content={title} />
      <meta
        name="twitter:description"
        content={description || siteMetadata.description || ""}
      />
    </Helmet>
  )
}

export default Seo
\end{codeInput}

\begin{codeInput}{sass}{toasts.scss}{A small SASS file.}
.Toastify__progress-bar--default {
  background: \$primary !important;
}
\end{codeInput}

You can also include code from a file. For example, here's a SCSS file:

\codeFromFile{sass}{\_toasts.scss}{The custom styling for the app's toasts.}{./snippets/_toasts.scss}

\codeFromFile{jsx}{Seo.tsx}{The custom styling for the app's toasts.}{./snippets/Seo.tsx}

\minisec{Figures}

Figures. Figures are also important. Here is an image:

\standardfigure{\textwidth/2}{folder-one/example}{Example caption for the image.}

They'll show up automatically in the list of figures.

\minisec{Emojis}

Emojis can also be fun to include in a book. You can use them by the custom commands that are included in this .tex file. Here are some examples:

Soup: \soup
Beers: \beers
Party Popper: \partypopper

That's about it! Those should be all the components you need to write an amazing software engineering book. Good luck!
