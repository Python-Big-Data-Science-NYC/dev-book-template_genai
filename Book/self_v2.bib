To provide deeper insights, a synthesis chart and chronological analysis are included to highlight significant trends and contributions. Building upon this foundation, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic future interest rate data. These generated projections are then integrated as inputs into the Vasicek model, dynamically adjusting its parameters with the support of AI-driven synthetic data. Additionally, we propose the use of publicly available financial information, gathered via public-facing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to assess whether the models project trends in line with real-world data. Specifically, we will query ChatGPT to analyze 50 key questions related to interest rates, risk management strategies, inflation, and economic indicators from institutions like the Federal Reserve and banks. Our approach also leverages publicly available information to refine model outputs, reducing reliance on assumptions and emphasizing the alignment of AI-generated noise with observable market behaviors. By integrating these real-world insights, we aim to ensure that our models remain both innovative and grounded in current economic realities.

We have rated the accuracy of the questions by taking a survey of three Risk Analysts (volunteers) and found that Gen AI is 70-80\% accurate in terms of the question for the models it generated. The new and the old model for open ai vs Gemini were compared. We have also documented how different models are sensitive to different prompts as they want to save computational cost and keep the output relevant. These questions generated can be used and integrated in the backend and auto curate the models under analyst supervision. We proposed a full stack framework as an end to end solution to address issues related to privacy and ethical considerations limiting exposure of property data and models.

The review identifies gaps in existing research, particularly in quantifying AI's long-term impact on learning outcomes and institutional adoption. From a business perspective, AI is enhancing decision-making, operational efficiency, and risk management. This paper also outlines research gaps and areas requiring further study, particularly in long-term AI workforce integration, ethical AI governance, and the economic implications of AI-driven productivity shifts. By providing a structured overview of existing literature and quantitative trends, this review contributes to ongoing discussions about AI's role in shaping future economic and professional landscapes.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of prompt engineering in optimizing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini for financial market integrity and risk management. As AI tools are increasingly integrated into financial services, including credit risk analysis, market risk evaluation, and financial modeling, prompt engineering has become crucial for improving the relevance, accuracy, and contextual alignment of AI-generated outputs. This study evaluates the impact of various prompt configurations in enhancing financial decision-making. Through a series of experiments, the paper compares the performance of ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini (versions 1.5 and 2.0) in generating actionable insights for credit and market risk analysis. The results reveal that ChatGPT-4 outperforms Google Gemini by over 30\% in generating accurate financial insights. Additionally, ChatGPT-4 Version 4 is found to be 20\% more effective than Version 3 in risk analysis tasks, particularly in aligning with regulatory frameworks and financial data. These improvements highlight the significant role of prompt engineering in enhancing the precision of financial models. Furthermore, the study explores the reduction of error rates through optimized prompt strategies. In particular, prompt engineering reduces error rates by approximately 20\% when assessing complex financial queries.},
