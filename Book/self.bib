	abstract = {In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a prototype for leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) in financial risk analysis, specifically focusing on fine-tuning GPT models with proprietary data. Financial risk modeling, development, validation, and approval require not only advanced AI techniques but also careful implementation, given the vast and complex datasets involved in such tasks. The research underscores the critical importance of human oversight in mitigating potential failures that can arise from fully automated mathematical models.
The study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various financial risk domains, such as credit risk assessment, market risk forecasting, and anomaly detection. While synthetic data generation is excluded from this work, the research highlights the use of zero-shot classification leveraging Hugging Face models and OpenAI tools. ChatGPT achieved over 70\% accuracy in generating relevant questions and demonstrated 60\% correctness in classification tasks. Additionally, we present a prototype pipeline that integrates GenAI capabilities into financial workflows, which is implementable on small-scale computing systems. This includes backend testing via Flask and rapid prototyping using cURL commands, offering a practical approach to testing and deploying models. By fine-tuning GenAI with domain-specific data and optimizing decision-making processes, this research highlights the transformative potential of integrating generative AI into financial risk management. The study provides insights into enhancing model efficiency, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Moreover, it addresses critical challenges such as handling large datasets and ensuring ethical AI use in decision-making systems. This work contributes to advancing the adoption of GenAI in financial analytics, paving the way for innovative, robust, and efficient methodologies to support the evolving demands of the financial sector.},

	abstract = {With Gen AI models becoming more evolved, their application in enhancing the robustness of the US Financial System is more viable. Financial risk modeling can take advantage of these development and aid regulatory framework by integrating these novel technologies to make their models more robust. In this work, we have used the latest Gen AI model by Open AI also known as Chat-GPT 4o and 40 mini and Google Gemini Version 2.0 and 1.5 to generate relevant questions from govt websites and measure the accuracy and relevance in checking the the pre trained logistic regression models. We have rated the accuracy of the questions by taking a survey of three Risk Analysts (volunteers) and found that Gen AI is 70-80\% accurate in terms of the question for the models it generated. The new and the old model for open ai vs Gemini were compared. We have also documented how different models are sensitive to different prompts as they want to save computational cost and keep the output relevant. These questions generated can be used and integrated in the backend and auto curate the models under analyst supervision. We proposed a full stack framework as an end to end solution to address issues related to privacy and ethical considerations limiting exposure of property data and models. We have used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the bridging APIs for creating variants of the queries.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the current data engineering aspect of Generative AI (GenAI) in financial risk management, focusing on data engineering, modern data platforms, and data lakes in the very fast changing paradigms and only focus on the last one year of research in this area. Generative AI technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini, are reshaping how financial institutions assess market and credit risks. The study emphasizes the critical importance of robust data architectures, including optimized data lakes, cloud platforms, and scalable infrastructure, to support these AI-driven systems. By examining the contributions of organizations like Oracle, Cloudera, and Microsoft, the paper highlights advancements in data engineering strategies, including efficient data pipelines and optimized data retrieval systems, which are essential for integrating GenAI into financial decision-making processes. Additionally, the paper explores the role of data platforms, such as Oracle’s HeatWave, in enabling real-time processing and analysis of financial data and compares it with the other equivalent implementations. A key focus is on the integration of vector databases, which enhance AI workflows by enabling fast similarity searches in high-dimensional datasets. These databases play a crucial role in improving the accuracy, speed, and relevance of financial insights and predictive modeling. By synthesizing insights from industry and academic research, this paper identifies opportunities and challenges in leveraging data engineering and GenAI technologies to optimize financial risk management processes.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the role of prompt engineering in optimizing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini for financial market integrity and risk management. As AI tools are increasingly integrated into financial services, including credit risk analysis, market risk evaluation, and financial modeling, prompt engineering has become crucial for improving the relevance, accuracy, and contextual alignment of AI-generated outputs. This study evaluates the impact of various prompt configurations in enhancing financial decision-making. Through a series of experiments, the paper compares the performance of ChatGPT-4 and Google Gemini (versions 1.5 and 2.0) in generating actionable insights for credit and market risk analysis. The results reveal that ChatGPT-4 outperforms Google Gemini by over 30\% in generating accurate financial insights. Additionally, ChatGPT-4 Version 4 is found to be 20\% more effective than Version 3 in risk analysis tasks, particularly in aligning with regulatory frameworks and financial data. These improvements highlight the significant role of prompt engineering in enhancing the precision of financial models. Furthermore, the study explores the reduction of error rates through optimized prompt strategies. In particular, prompt engineering reduces error rates by approximately 20\% when assessing complex financial queries.},

Building upon this foundation, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic future interest rate data. These generated projections are then integrated as inputs into the Vasicek model, dynamically adjusting its parameters with the support of AI-driven synthetic data. Additionally, we propose the use of publicly available financial information, gathered via public-facing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to assess whether the models project trends in line with real-world data. Specifically, we will query ChatGPT to analyze 50 key questions related to interest rates, risk management strategies, inflation, and economic indicators from institutions like the Federal Reserve and banks. Our approach also leverages publicly available information to refine model outputs, reducing reliance on assumptions and emphasizing the alignment of AI-generated noise with observable market behaviors. By integrating these real-world insights, we aim to ensure that our models remain both innovative and grounded in current economic realities.
