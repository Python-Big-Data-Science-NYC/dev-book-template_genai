%X With Gen AI models becoming more evolved, their application in enhancing the robustness of the US Financial System is more viable. Financial risk modeling can take advantage of these development and aid regulatory framework by integrating these novel technologies to make their models more robust. In this work, we have used the latest Gen AI model by Open AI also known as Chat-GPT 4o and 40 mini and Google Gemini Version 2.0 and 1.5 to generate relevant questions from govt websites and measure the accuracy and relevance in checking the the pre trained logistic regression models. We have rated the accuracy of the questions by taking a survey of three Risk Analysts (volunteers) and found that Gen AI is 70-80% accurate in terms of the question for the models it generated. The new and the old model for open ai vs Gemini were compared. We have also documented how different models are sensitive to different prompts as they want to save computational cost and keep the output relevant. These questions generated can be used and integrated in the backend and auto curate the models under analyst supervision. We proposed a full stack framework as an end to end solution to address issues related to privacy and ethical considerations limiting exposure of property data and models. We have used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the bridging APIs for creating variants of the queries.

%X In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a prototype for leveraging Generative AI (GenAI) in financial risk analysis, specifically focusing on fine-tuning GPT models with proprietary data. Financial risk modeling, development, validation, and approval require not only advanced AI techniques but also careful implementation, given the vast and complex datasets involved in such tasks. The research underscores the critical importance of human oversight in mitigating potential failures that can arise from fully automated mathematical models.
The study explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various financial risk domains, such as credit risk assessment, market risk forecasting, and anomaly detection. While synthetic data generation is excluded from this work, the research highlights the use of zero-shot classification leveraging Hugging Face models and OpenAI tools. ChatGPT achieved over 70% accuracy in generating relevant questions and demonstrated 60% correctness in classification tasks. Additionally, we present a prototype pipeline that integrates GenAI capabilities into financial workflows, which is implementable on small-scale computing systems. This includes backend testing via Flask and rapid prototyping using cURL commands, offering a practical approach to testing and deploying models. By fine-tuning GenAI with domain-specific data and optimizing decision-making processes, this research highlights the transformative potential of integrating generative AI into financial risk management. The study provides insights into enhancing model efficiency, regulatory compliance, and scalability. Moreover, it addresses critical challenges such as handling large datasets and ensuring ethical AI use in decision-making systems. This work contributes to advancing the adoption of GenAI in financial analytics, paving the way for innovative, robust, and efficient methodologies to support the evolving demands of the financial sector.

%X This work explores the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), into statistical and structural financial models, with a focus on the Leland-Toft and Box-Cox frameworks. We conduct a comprehensive review of these models, highlighting their use in financial risk analysis, bankruptcy prediction, and time-series forecasting. Through the integration of VAEs, we demonstrate their capability to enhance data generation, improve predictive accuracy, and enable robust validation of financial models, particularly in scenarios with scarce data. The application of VAEs to the Leland-Toft model facilitated the calculation of key financial metrics, including default spreads, credit spreads, and leverage ratios. Additionally, VAEs integrated with Box-Cox models generated latent features that correlated effectively with traditional financial factors, underscoring their utility in predictive modeling and survival analysis. This work provides a detailed overview of implementation pipelines, architecture diagrams, and model validation methods, offering a foundation for future research. Expanding on the use of VAEs, we propose incorporating advanced machine learning techniques and real-time data to further enhance model performance and revolutionize financial modeling.We have discussed how implementation of synthetic data to enhance inputs for Leland-Toft and Box-Cox can aid is robust validation of the models.

%U https://www.irjmets.com/uploadedfiles/paper//issue_1_january_2025/66819/final/fin_irjmets1738056751.pdf
%X This paper provides a comprehensive review of the Vasicek model and its applications in finance, categorizing the literature into four key areas: Vasicek model applications, Monte Carlo simulations, negative interest rates and risk, and deep learning for financial time series. To provide deeper insights, a synthesis chart and chronological analysis are included to highlight significant trends and contributions. Building upon this foundation, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic future interest rate data. These generated projections are then integrated as inputs into the Vasicek model, dynamically adjusting its parameters with the support of AI-driven synthetic data. Additionally, we propose the use of publicly available financial information, gathered via public-facing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, to assess whether the models project trends in line with real-world data. Specifically, we will query ChatGPT to analyze 50 key questions related to interest rates, risk management strategies, inflation, and economic indicators from institutions like the Federal Reserve and banks. Our approach also leverages publicly available information to refine model outputs, reducing reliance on assumptions and emphasizing the alignment of AI-generated noise with observable market behaviors. By integrating these real-world insights, we aim to ensure that our models remain both innovative and grounded in current economic realities. Ultimately, this framework combines advanced generative AI models, such as GANs and VAEs, with human oversight and economic data, providing a robust, adaptable, and forward-thinking approach to financial risk modeling.
